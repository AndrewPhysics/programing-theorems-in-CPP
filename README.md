# programing-theorems-in-CPP
12 basic programming theorems implemented in CPP language.

1. summation of integer values stored in 1 dimensional array  

2. replecament of variables x and y, values are passed by reference type 

3. decision making theorem
function: the P_property(a[i])==true statement in the function returns true when the current value is divisible by 3
(that was the P property). The second version is shorter because the using of && operator.

4. conditional sum theorem: only those elements summed which have the p property

5. conditional count function: only those elements counted which have the p property

6. conditional select theorem: the function will give the position of element having P_property(a[i])==true statement

7. select maximum theorem: function will select the max value in the array

8. linear search theorem

9. sorting by replecament

10. sorting by bubble sort

11. sorting by max or min selection

12. assortment theorem
